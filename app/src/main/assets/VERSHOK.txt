Cf. A rack unit (abbreviated U or RU) is a unit of measure defined as 1 3‚ÅÑ4 inches (44.45 mm).[1][2] It is most frequently used as a measurement of the overall height of 19-inch and 23-inch rack frames, as well as the height of equipment that mounts in these frames, whereby the height of the frame or equipment is expressed as multiples of rack units. For example, a typical full-size rack cage is 42U high, while equipment is typically 1U, 2U, 3U, or 4U high.
