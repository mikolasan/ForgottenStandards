An ell (from Proto-Germanic *alin≈ç, cognate with Latin ulna) is a unit of measurement originally understood as a cubit, the combined length of the forearm and extended hand. The word literally means "arm" and survives in the modern English world "elbow" (arm-bend). Later usage through the 19th century refers to several longer units, some of which are thought to derive from a "double ell".
