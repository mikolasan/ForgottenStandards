Though for many physical quantities, SI prefixes for factors of 10^3—like milli- and kilo-—are often preferred by technicians, the centimetre remains a practical unit of length for many everyday measurements. A centimetre is approximately the width of the fingernail of an average adult person.

In addition to its use in the measurement of length, the centimetre is used: sometimes, to report the level of rainfall as measured by a rain gauge; in maps, centimetres are used to make conversions from map scale to real world scale (kilometres).
